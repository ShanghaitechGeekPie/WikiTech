# Welcome to WikiTech

WikiTech is a Wiki-style encyclopedia site for ShanghaiTech University, editable by all faculty and students, providing quick information lookup services for the university community.

Since our primary language is Chinese and only a small portion of pages are written in English, we recommend using **browser translation plugins** for previewing.

English pages may not be maintained as promptly as Chinese pages. **Some of the details might be out-of-dated.** If you're willing to help maintain them, we'd be delighted!
